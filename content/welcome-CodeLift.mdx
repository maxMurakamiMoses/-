Today we're releasing **CodeLift**, a next-gen AI assistant built for modern dev teams that want to move faster, write cleaner code, and squash bugs automatically. 🛠️

## Why We Built CodeLift

Engineering teams waste hours on:

- Debugging repetitive issues
- Searching for syntax and doc examples
- Reviewing PRs manually

CodeLift removes the noise so developers can build with clarity.

## Our Mission

1. **Shorten Debug Cycles**: Spot bugs before they break production.
2. **Level Up Every Dev**: AI-assisted code suggestions tailored to your stack.
3. **Automate Reviews**: AI does the first pass so humans focus on what matters.

## Core Capabilities

- **Inline Code Suggestions**: Smarter than autocomplete
- **Auto-Fix for Common Bugs**: One-click fixes for known patterns
- **Codebase-Aware Chat**: Ask questions about your own repo
- **AI PR Reviews**: Catch regressions and flag risky changes
- **Custom Language Models**: Fine-tuned to your style guide

## Why Engineers Love CodeLift
