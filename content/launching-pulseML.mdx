We're thrilled to launch **PulseML**, a lightning-fast machine learning engine designed to keep your business ahead of the curve. ⚡️

## The Bottleneck We're Solving

Enterprises today wrestle with:

- Slow model deployment cycles
- Fragmented ML toolchains
- Costly infrastructure overhead

PulseML streamlines the entire lifecycle—from training to deployment—so your data science team can ship models, not tickets.

## Our Mission

1. **Speed Up Deployment**: Deploy models to production in hours, not weeks.
2. **Simplify Your Stack**: All-in-one interface for data scientists and engineers.
3. **Scale Smarter**: Auto-scale compute only when you need it.

## Core Capabilities

- **One-Click Deployments**: Push models live from Jupyter, VSCode, or CLI
- **Smart Resource Allocation**: Never overpay for idle compute
- **Cross-Cloud Flexibility**: Deploy to AWS, Azure, or GCP with zero config
- **Continuous Training Pipelines**: Keep models fresh without manual intervention
- **Model Governance Dashboard**: Track lineage, metrics, and compliance in real time

## Why PulseML is Different

> "With PulseML, our ML deployment time shrunk by 80%. It’s our secret weapon." – Mia Tran, Head of Data Science at NeuronIQ
